# Blackmagic HyperDeck Control API

This document describes the subset of BlackMagic's HyperDeck Control REST and Websocket APIs used for this project.

The complete API description can be found [here](https://documents.blackmagicdesign.com/DeveloperManuals/RESTAPIForHyperDeck.pdf)

All endpoints are underneath the path "/control/api/v1"

# Overall workflows

This section describes the expected owrkflow that the client will use

## Switching to live view

1. `PUT /transports/0/` with mode set to "InputPreview"

## Starting a recording

1. `POST /transports/0/record` to start a recording with a particular name
2. `GET /transports/0/clip` to read the metadata of the clip

## Stopping a recording

1. `POST /transports/0/stop` to stop the recording session
2. `GET /transports/0/clip` to refresh the final metadata for the clip

## Warping to a particular clip

1. Look up the clip in the list reported by the `/timelines/0` event
2. `PUT /transports/0/playback` with the following parameters:

```json
{
    "type": "Jog",
    "loop": false,
    "singleClip": true,
    "speed": 1.0,
    "position": <timelineIn value for the clip>
}
```

## Warping to a moment within a clip

Same as "Warping to a particular clip", but add an offset to the "position" field to hit the desired moment in the clip

# Websocket API

A websocket API is exposed for receiving real-time updates to state from the device. The client sends a request subscribing to a number of events,
and then the server sends events any time the data for a subscribed event changes.

The websocket can be connected at the "/control/api/v1/events/websocket" endpoint.
